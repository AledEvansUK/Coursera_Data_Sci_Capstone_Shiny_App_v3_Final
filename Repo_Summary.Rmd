#### This GitHub repo is for the final submission for the Capstone Project of the [Coursera & Johns Hopkins University (in association with Swiftkey).](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project)

#### The Shiny App can be found on [shinyapps.io](https://aledevans.shinyapps.io/Coursera_Data_Sci_Capstone_Shiny_App_v3_Final/)

#### The Shiny application ('app') suggests the next word following text input from the user.

#### The Shiny App works across devices, but is optimised for use on a desktop web browser.

#### The predictive algorithm uses the n-gram frequency to suggest/ predict the next word based on the users input. The model checks the phrase length and starts with the quintgram, then moves onto quadgram and so on. The model is a version of a ['back-off' model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz%27s_back-off_model).
